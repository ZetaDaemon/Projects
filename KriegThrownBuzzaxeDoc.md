# Krieg Thrown Buzzaxe Doc
## Buzzaxe Damage Formula
Buzzaxe Damage = ( \[ Player Level * 0.02 + 1 \] * 80 * 1.13 ^ \[ Player Level + OP Level \] + 2.5 * Roid Damage ) * 0.6  

## Standard Thrown Buzzaxe
1 * Buzzaxe Damage as normal Melee Damage with a radius of 0.  
0.05 * Buzzaxe Damage as normal Rocket Damage with a radius of 10.  

## Buzz Axe Bombardier
1 * Buzzaxe Damage as normal Grenade Damage with a radius of 0.  
1 * Buzzaxe Damage as explosive Grenade Damage with a radius of 400, this can hurt you.  

## Fire Fiend
1 * Buzzaxe Damage as normal Melee Damage with a radius of 0.  
0.05 * Buzzaxe Damage as normal Rocket Damage with a radius of 10.  

Additionally there are 2 fire damage events that have a chance to trigger when hitting an enemy, the normal Fire Fiend burn when dealing melee damage as buzzaxe is still dealing melee damage and then the buzzaxe has its own extra chance to deal fire damage to ignite enemies.
Both of these fire damage events will always burn the enemy if they trigger, but they only have a chance to trigger in the first place.  
These fire damage events will deal only 1 damage as it just needs some damage to trigger the burn.  

## Buzz Axe Bombardier + Fire Fiend
1 * Buzzaxe Damage as normal Grenade Damage with a radius of 0.  
1 * Buzzaxe Damage as explosive Grenade Damage with a radius of 400, this can hurt you.  

Now the burn chance from thrown buzzaxes works a bit differently, since the axe no longer deals melee you dont get the standard fire fiend burn chance but you still get the additional burn chance from the axe itself.  
Same as before if the fire damage event triggers it will always burn, it just only has a chance to trigger.  
The fire damage still only does 1 damage.
